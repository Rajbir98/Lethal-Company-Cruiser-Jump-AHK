## Modes

### 1. TO SHIP WITH MAGNET
I'll add a video for the line u have to do later, basically it's the back of the mountain line up if you know it
I kinda think this one is unreliable, idk tho, I must have gotten the lineup wrong a lot of times

### 2. TO FIRE EXIT (ECLIPSE JUMP)
The line up for this is simple, just drop the cruiser from the magnet, sit in, set it to driv,e look at the door(so the script can make u exit the car in case the landing isn't smooth), and activate the script

### 3. TO SHIP NO MAGNET
In this, the lineup is basically remember u put your car in a tiny wall section at the right side of the fire exit, you do the jump from there, no need to back your car up

## Notes

- Make sure you are facing the correct direction before running a sequence.
- Adjust `Sleep` values (in milliseconds) if timing feels off.
- The script only sends keyboard inputs — it does not modify game files. YOU WILL NOT GET BANNED FOR TS
