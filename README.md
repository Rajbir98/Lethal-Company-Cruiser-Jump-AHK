# Cruiser Jump AHK

It's pretty simple to use. " \ " is to change modes, and " ] " is to execute the jumps

There are 2 modes

- D Movement, which is used to do the jump from the ship to the fire exit.
- A Movement that is used to do the jump from the fire exit to the ship.

## Note: 
- You must position the cruiser appropriately before doing any of these jumps
-  For A Movement, your cruiser must be outside the fire exit, touching the edge of the mountain.
- For D Movement, your cruiser can be just underneath the magnet, though make sure to look at the door while doing the jump.

So if I had to do a jump, I'd position my cruiser, then I'd press " \ " to change to my desired jump mode and then press " ] " to execute
It does take a while to get used to but it's pretty simple
